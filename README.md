### Brief project description
This project took the concepts of a hybrid model to improve AEMO’s short-term electricity demand forecast by incorporating modelling the AEMO forecast errors in a subsequent model and adding these the AEMO’s forecast to produce a more accurate prediction. The project found that for all models tested, modelling the errors improved the accuracy of the short-term forecast improved.
